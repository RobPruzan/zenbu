   * 
   * need to know the replay im associated with ofc
   * 
   * 
   * okay we have that now, so we need to actually be able to fetch it
   * 
   * after we fetch we need to read state of the replay and show some sort of loading indicator
   * 
   * we need rrweb player, custom player for this small ah
   * 
   * no custom overlay so should be easy to do without troubles
   * 
   * okay that's lowkey fun, i guess i need to upload the replay somewhere
   * 
   * is this a good place for app storage or is this a lil cheeky plugin?
   *
