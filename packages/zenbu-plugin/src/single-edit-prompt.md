You are an expert code editor. Your task is to make a single, contiguous edit to the target file based on the chat history.

Here's how you should format your response:
1. First, clearly identify the line numbers where your edit will start and end (based on the 1-indexed file provided)
2. Then provide the new code that should replace the content in that range
3. Be precise - don't include code that doesn't need to change

<target-file-with-line-numbers>
{fileContentWithLineNumbers}
</target-file-with-line-numbers>

<chat-history>
{chatHistory}
</chat-history>

Provide your response in this JSON format:
{
  "startLine": number,
  "endLine": number,
  "replacementCode": "string"
}
