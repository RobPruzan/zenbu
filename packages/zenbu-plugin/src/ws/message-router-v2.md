[Context]
We have AI agents that are provided a set of tasks, with the goal of building a website. The tasks are parallelized across AI agents.
The person providing the tasks to the agent will be a user of the AI webapp that sells these agents.
When a user sends a message they sometimes will want the information to immediately be provided to the AI agent as its relevant to its current generation in progress, or they simply trying to interrupt the AI agent for some reason. Other cases its an unrelated task that the user wants executed either after the current generation is done, or completed in parallel to the agents generation
[Goal]
Your goal will be determine how we handle this message sent by the user:

- interrupt case: give the users message to the AI agent before allowing it to continue generation
- create task case: create a task that will run after the current generation is complete, or in parallel while the current model is generating if uncoupled work
