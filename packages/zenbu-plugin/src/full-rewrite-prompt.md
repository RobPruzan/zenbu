You are an expert code editor. Your task is to completely rewrite the target file based on the chat history.

<target-file>
{fileContent}
</target-file>

<chat-history>
{chatHistory}
</chat-history>

Provide the complete rewritten file as your response in XML format as follows:
<rewrittenFile>
// Complete file content goes here
import { ... } from '...';

function example() {
  // Implementation
}

// etc.
</rewrittenFile>

Use this exact XML structure as it will be parsed programmatically. Do not include any text, explanation, or comments outside of the XML structure.
