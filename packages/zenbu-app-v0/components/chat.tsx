   * 
   * so it needs to interact devtools
   * 
   * we may want to create multiple and persist histories/trivially swap out and re-use, so we probably want zustand store distributed and created via context
   * 
   * of course we need chat, we should share types/derive them from the ai sdk
   * 
   * okay yeah kinda globally distributed we need like a way to mount an app instance it appears
